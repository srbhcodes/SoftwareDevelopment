try to understand my style of explanation and then tell me what kind of style it is, like use all the analysis for it, okay? i'll do for the fetch, so here it goes: first lets' talk and think about what we've to do, so we've to fetch the api from the dummy api and show it on our screen so that's our task, after thinking about the task, let's now think more fundamentally, so fetch is an async task, a task which needs to be perfomed in the background, its a side task, so we need to use it inside useEffect, okay, so its a async task we need to use it inside useEffect, so here we go, we'll have useEffect and because its a function so parentheses useEffect() now it accepts two parameters, one is callback function and other is dependecy array, so we'll use callback function, in that we'll use fetch function and as fetch is an async task, it will return a promise, either in 3 states, but right now we'll only deal with the success so only then, so first we'll fetch, and will give the link, then yes after we've got it, we've to convert it, otherwise how'we'll use it, so .then((res) => res.json()) so first whatever we've got we'll convert that into json so first of all it should be readable, after we've converted we need to store it somewhere, we can hold it in hands, we've to store in a variable and as the variable needs to be rendered on screen it should be a powerful varaible that is state variable , so let's create a state variable, that is todo, and to change it we'll have setTodo function, const [todo, setTodo] = useState([]); and ues we'll import the useEffect and useState from react, and as they''re named import we'll have them in curly braces: import { useEffect, useState } from "react"; so third step which we'll do is that we'll put it in into state variable .then((data) => setTodo(data.todo)); so here what it looks like overall useEffect(() => { // 1. Fetch the data from the server fetch("https://dummyjson.com/todos") // 2. Convert the fetched response to JSON .then((res) => res.json()) // 3. Store the JSON data in our state .then((data) => setTodo(data.todo)); }, []); so this is how fetch works you can say!
