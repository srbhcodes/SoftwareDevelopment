### **React Rendering Process**

#### **1. Initial Render**

When a React app starts for the first time:

- **React creates the Virtual DOM.**
    - React creates a lightweight JavaScript object tree that mirrors the actual DOM structure.
    - This Virtual DOM represents the UI at its initial state.

#### **2. State or Props Change**

When you update the state (e.g., calling `setState` or `useState`):

- **State/Props changes trigger re-rendering** of the corresponding component.
    - React detects which component's state or props changed.
    - It marks the affected component(s) for "re-rendering."

#### **3. Virtual DOM Update**

React re-renders the affected component:

- **A new Virtual DOM tree is created.**
    - This tree represents the UI _after_ the state change.
    - For example:
        
        ```javascript
        setCount(count + 1);
        ```
        
        - React creates a new tree where the `<h1>` element now says `Counter: 1` instead of `Counter: 0`.

#### **4. Diffing Algorithm (Reconciliation)**

React compares the **old Virtual DOM** (before the state change) with the **new Virtual DOM** (after the state change):

- React uses an optimized **diffing algorithm** to identify **exactly what changed**.
    - Example:
        - Old Virtual DOM: `<h1>Counter: 0</h1>`
        - New Virtual DOM: `<h1>Counter: 1</h1>`
        - **React detects that only the text inside `<h1>` changed.**

#### **5. Real DOM Update**

After identifying changes:

- React applies **only the necessary updates** to the real DOM.
    - It does **not re-render the entire DOM.**
    - In this case, React updates only the text content of the `<h1>` element.

#### **6. Batch Updates**

If there are multiple updates (e.g., text change + color change):

- React groups all updates together (called **batching**).
- Instead of updating the DOM multiple times, React makes a **single DOM update.**

#### **7. Browser Rendering**

Finally:

- The browser processes the updated DOM.
- It recalculates styles, performs layout adjustments, and repaints the screen.

### **Detailed Example: Counter with React**

#### **Initial Setup**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+ Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When the app loads:

1. React creates a **Virtual DOM**:
    
    ```json
    {
      type: "div",
      props: {
        children: [
          {
            type: "h1",
            props: { children: "Counter: 0" }
          },
          {
            type: "button",
            props: { children: "+ Increment", onClick: [Function] }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
2. React converts this Virtual DOM into the **real DOM**:
    
    ```html
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: 0</h1>
      <button>+ Increment</button>
    </div>
    ```
    

---

#### **On Button Click**

When you click the `+ Increment` button:

1. **State Updates:** `setCount(count + 1)` updates the state.
    
2. **Component Re-render:** React re-renders the `Counter` component.
    
    - A new Virtual DOM is created:
        
        ```json
        {
          type: "div",
          props: {
            children: [
              {
                type: "h1",
                props: { children: "Counter: 1" }
              },
              {
                type: "button",
                props: { children: "+ Increment", onClick: [Function] }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        
3. **Diffing Algorithm:**
    
    - React compares the old Virtual DOM with the new one.
    - It detects that:
        - Only the `children` of `<h1>` changed (`"Counter: 0"` → `"Counter: 1"`).
    - All other elements remain unchanged.
4. **DOM Update:**
    
    - React updates only the text content of `<h1>` in the real DOM:
        
        ```html
        <h1>Counter: 1</h1>
        ```
        
5. **Browser Rendering:**
    
    - The browser recalculates styles, reflows layout, and repaints the screen.

### **How This Differs from Plain JavaScript**

#### **React:**

- **Creates Virtual DOMs:** React maintains a virtual representation of the DOM.
- **Diffs Efficiently:** React only calculates differences between old and new Virtual DOMs.
- **Batches Updates:** Multiple changes are grouped into a single DOM update.
- **Minimal DOM Interaction:** Only the required parts of the DOM are updated.

#### **Plain JavaScript:**

- **Direct DOM Updates:** You interact directly with the DOM (e.g., `document.getElementById`).
- **No Optimizations:** Every update directly triggers DOM reflows and repaints.
- **No Batching:** Each DOM update happens immediately, even if they’re redundant or unnecessary.
- **Developer Management:** You must manually handle which parts of the DOM need updates, increasing complexity.

### **Performance Comparison: React vs JavaScript**

|**Aspect**|**React**|**Plain JavaScript**|
|---|---|---|
|**UI Updates**|Virtual DOM diff + minimal update|Direct DOM manipulation|
|**Reflows/Repaints**|Reduced and batched|Frequent and uncontrolled|
|**Multiple Updates**|Batched and optimized|Handled individually|
|**Ease of Maintenance**|High (React manages updates)|Low (manual DOM management required)|

### **Conclusion**

React's efficiency comes from:

1. Using a **Virtual DOM** to avoid frequent real DOM updates.
2. Applying **diffing algorithms** to update only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
3. **Batching updates** to reduce the number of reflows and repaints.
4. Abstracting the complexity of DOM updates, allowing developers to focus on the state and UI logic.
