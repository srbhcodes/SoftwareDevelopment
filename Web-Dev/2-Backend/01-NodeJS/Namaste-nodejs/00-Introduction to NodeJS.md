### Episode 00: Introduction to Node.js

#### **What is Node.js?**
- **JavaScript Runtime**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.  
  - A runtime is an environment in which a programming language (like JavaScript) can be executed.
  - The V8 engine is Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, used in Google Chrome and Node.js.

- **Cross-platform**:  
  - Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it works on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Open-source**:  
  - It is open-source, meaning its code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and contribute to.

- **JavaScript Outside the Browser**:  
  - Traditionally, JavaScript runs in web browsers, but Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a browser environment. This opens up the ability to use JavaScript for server-side applications, command-line tools, etc.

#### **Key Features of Node.js**:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:  
   - Node.js operates on an event-driven architecture where an event loop processes tasks, making it efficient for handling multiple tasks at once.
   
2. **Asynchronous I/O**:  
   - It supports non-blocking I/O operations. This means that Node.js does not wait for operations (like reading a file or querying a database) to complete before moving on to the next task. This makes it highly scalable and fast.

### History of Node.js

1. **2009: Node.js Created by Ryan Dahl**:
   - **Ryan Dahl** developed Node.js in 2009.
   - Dahl saw potential in building an event-driven, non-blocking I/O environment that could handle numerous simultaneous connections without blocking the server.
   - It became popular because of its potential to handle high concurrency, scalability, and speed.

2. **JavaScript Engines**:
   - **JavaScript needs a JavaScript engine** to execute. Different environments use different engines:
     - **SpiderMonkey**: The engine for Mozilla Firefox.
     - **V8**: The engine used by Chrome, and later by Node.js.
   - Dahl initially started developing Node.js using the SpiderMonkey engine but switched to the V8 engine due to its superior performance.

3. **Joyent's Involvement**:
   - **Joyent**, a cloud infrastructure company, saw the potential in Node.js and provided funding for its further development. Ryan Dahl joined Joyent, and Node.js started gaining industry traction.

4. **Node.js was Initially Called Web.js**:
   - The original name of Node.js was "Web.js" because Dahl's initial intention was to build a web server using JavaScript.
   - However, he realized that the platform could be used for more than just web servers, so he renamed it to **Node.js** (to represent the concept of creating nodes in a network).

5. **Blocking I/O vs. Non-Blocking I/O**:
   - **Apache HTTP Server** (a popular web server at the time) used blocking I/O, meaning each operation had to wait for the previous one to finish before starting.
   - Ryan Dahl aimed to solve this limitation by creating a **non-blocking I/O** system with Node.js, making it highly efficient for tasks like handling multiple connections simultaneously.

### Evolution of Node.js

1. **2010: npm (Node Package Manager)**:
   - **npm** was introduced in 2010 as a package manager for Node.js.
   - npm allows developers to share and reuse code by creating small packages (modules) for various functionalities (e.g., dealing with images, web servers, databases).
   - **Node.js's success is closely tied to npm**, as the ecosystem of packages allows developers to build applications faster by reusing code from others.

2. **2011: Windows Support**:
   - Initially, Node.js was only available for macOS and Linux.
   - In 2011, through collaboration between **Joyent and Microsoft**, Node.js gained support for Windows, expanding its reach to a larger audience.

3. **2012: Ryan Dahl Steps Down**:
   - Ryan Dahl stepped down from maintaining Node.js in 2012.
   - **Isaac Schlueter**, the creator of npm, took over as the lead developer for Node.js.

4. **2014: io.js Fork**:
   - In 2014, a developer named **Fedor Indutny** created a fork of Node.js called **io.js**.
   - **io.js** was created because some developers were unhappy with the slow pace of Node.js development under Joyent's leadership.
   - io.js aimed to move faster in adopting modern JavaScript features and improving performance.

5. **2015: Node.js and io.js Merge**:
   - In September 2015, io.js and Node.js merged, creating a unified project under the **Node.js Foundation**.
   - The Node.js Foundation was created to ensure that Node.js could be developed transparently and collaboratively.

6. **2019: OpenJS Foundation**:
   - In 2019, the **OpenJS Foundation** took over the maintenance of Node.js.
   - OpenJS Foundation was created to provide a neutral home for various JavaScript-related projects (including Node.js), fostering collaboration and innovation.

### Summary of Key Milestones in Node.js History:
- **2009**: Node.js created by Ryan Dahl.
- **2010**: npm launched.
- **2011**: Windows support added.
- **2012**: Ryan Dahl steps down; Isaac Schlueter takes over.
- **2014**: io.js fork created.
- **2015**: Node.js and io.js merge under Node.js Foundation.
- **2019**: OpenJS Foundation takes over.

### Why Node.js is Important:
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Solves the problem of traditional servers blocking operations while waiting for I/O tasks to complete.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for handling high numbers of simultaneous connections.
- **npm Ecosystem**: Thousands of reusable modules/packages make it easier to build applications quickly.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on major operating systems.
- **JavaScript Everywhere**: Developers can use the same language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side development.
