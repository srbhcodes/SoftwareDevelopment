### Lecture 02: Node.js – JavaScript on the Server

#### **What is a Server?**
- A **server** is essentially a machine (or CPU) that **receives requests** and responds to them.  
  - In simple terms, it’s a powerful computer designed to manage network resources and provide services to clients (other computers or devices).
  
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - The **client** is the user-side (your computer, phone, etc.), which sends a request to the server.
  - For example, when you access `google.com`, your computer (the client) sends a request to the Google server.
  - **Domain to IP Mapping**: The domain (e.g., google.com) is mapped to an IP address, which identifies the server on the internet.

#### **JavaScript in the Browser and Server**:
- **JavaScript** was originally designed to run only in the browser (client-side) to handle tasks like interacting with the user interface, form validation, etc.
  
- **Node.js** brought JavaScript to the server-side:
  - **Before Node.js**, JavaScript could only be used in the browser.
  - **With Node.js**, JavaScript can now also run on the server. This opened up the possibility of using **JavaScript for full-stack development**.

---

#### **Full-stack Development with JavaScript**:
- **Full-stack development** refers to the ability to build both the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) of an application.
- **Node.js** enables developers to use JavaScript for both:
  - **Frontend**: The user interface (UI) of an application, which runs in the browser.
  - **Backend**: The server-side logic, database operations, and handling requests.
  
- **Technological Stacks**:  
  Node.js contributed to the development of popular full-stack technologies, such as:
  - **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
  - **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)
  These stacks allow developers to use **JavaScript for both the client and the server**.

#### **JavaScript Engine**:
- A **JavaScript engine** is responsible for executing JavaScript code.
  
- **Node.js and JavaScript Engines**:
  - **V8 Engine** is the most commonly used JavaScript engine, developed by Google.
  - Both **Chrome** and **Node.js** use the V8 engine.
  - V8 is written in **C++**, and its primary job is to **execute JavaScript code** by converting it into machine-readable code.

- **Embedding V8 in Programs**:
  - The V8 engine can be embedded into any C++ program, including Node.js, to allow JavaScript execution.
  - **Node.js itself is a C++ application** with the V8 engine embedded in it to execute JavaScript on the server.

---

#### **Why Node.js and Not Just V8?**
- If the V8 engine already executes JavaScript, you might wonder why Node.js is needed on the server.
- **Node.js adds "superpowers" to V8**, specifically server-side functionalities that aren't available in just the V8 engine alone. These include:
  - **File system handling**
  - **Networking capabilities**
  - **Asynchronous I/O**
  - **HTTP server creation** without needing other external software like Apache or NGINX.

- **In essence**, Node.js is a combination of the V8 engine and additional APIs that allow you to interact with the server and perform tasks like handling files, making network requests, and more. This makes Node.js a complete **JavaScript runtime**.

---

#### **JavaScript Standard (ECMAScript)**:
- **ECMAScript** is the standard or set of rules that defines how JavaScript should be written and executed.
  - ECMAScript is maintained by the **ECMA International** organization.
  
- Different **JavaScript engines** (like V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.) follow these ECMAScript standards to ensure that JavaScript code behaves consistently across browsers and environments.

- **Role of the JavaScript Engine**:
  - The **job of the JavaScript engine** is to look at your JavaScript code and translate it according to the ECMAScript standard. This ensures that your JavaScript code is correctly understood and executed.

---

#### **How V8 Works (Simplified View)**:
- **Low-level code execution**:
  - Computers understand binary (machine) code, but humans write code in high-level languages like JavaScript or C++.
  - The **JavaScript engine** (V8 in this case) is responsible for taking the JavaScript code and converting it into **machine code** that the computer can understand.
  
- **Layers of Abstraction**:
  1. **Binary Code**: The lowest level, which the computer directly understands.
  2. **Assembly Code**: A slightly more readable version of binary code that can be executed by a machine.
  3. **Machine Code**: Code executed by the computer’s CPU.
  4. **High-level Languages (C++, JavaScript)**: Code written by developers, which is then translated to machine code by engines or compilers.

- **How V8 Operates**:
  - **JavaScript code** is passed to the **V8 engine**.
  - The V8 engine, written in **C++**, translates this JavaScript code into **machine code** so that it can be executed directly by the computer’s processor.
  
  - **Node.js adds to V8**: 
    - On top of V8’s capability to execute JavaScript, Node.js provides **additional APIs** and features needed for server-side operations.

### Summary of Key Concepts:

1. **Server**: A computer or machine that receives requests from clients and responds to them.
   - Clients (like your browser) send requests to servers (like Google’s server), which are mapped through domain names and IP addresses.

2. **JavaScript in the Browser**: Initially, JavaScript only worked in web browsers to manage the frontend.
   - **Node.js** enabled JavaScript to run on servers, allowing developers to write server-side code in JavaScript.

3. **Full-stack JavaScript Development**: 
   - Thanks to Node.js, developers can now use JavaScript for both the frontend (browser) and backend (server).
   - This has led to the rise of stacks like **MERN** and **MEAN**, which use JavaScript for the entire development process.

4. **V8 JavaScript Engine**:
   - V8 is a **C++-based engine** that executes JavaScript code. It is used in both Chrome and Node.js.
   - **Node.js is a C++ application** that embeds the V8 engine, but it extends V8 with additional capabilities for server-side programming.

5. **ECMAScript Standards**:
   - JavaScript engines like V8 follow **ECMAScript** standards, which define how JavaScript should be written and executed to ensure consistency across different environments.

6. **Machine Code Conversion**:
   - JavaScript code is translated by the V8 engine (written in C++) into **machine code** that the computer’s processor can understand and execute.

7. **Node.js Superpowers**:
   - **Node.js adds APIs and functionalities** on top of V8, such as networking, file system management, and creating HTTP servers, making it a full-fledged **JavaScript runtime** for server-side development.
