### **Summary of Today's Tasks:**

Today, we worked on several important tasks to progress with your projects, including building Python scripts, setting up a Flask REST API, implementing an ETL pipeline, and setting up unit tests. Here's a breakdown of everything we did:

---

#### **1. Writing Scripts to Process CSV/JSON Data**
- We installed necessary Python libraries like `pandas` and `json`.
- We created Python scripts to load data from CSV and JSON files, processed that data, and converted it into different formats (e.g., converting a JSON into a CSV).
- This task allowed us to automate data processing steps that would be commonly needed in data analysis workflows.

#### **2. Building a REST API with Flask**
- We installed Flask, set up a virtual environment, and created a simple REST API that handles basic GET requests.
- We created routes to retrieve data in a structured format (JSON) and tested the API using `curl` to make sure it was working correctly.
- This task helped us learn how to build a simple API using Flask that can be expanded for larger applications.

#### **3. Creating a Simple ETL Pipeline and Loading Data into SQLite**
- We wrote Python code to simulate an ETL pipeline that extracts data, transforms it, and loads it into an SQLite database.
- This included installing the required libraries (`sqlite3`, `pandas`) and structuring the code to handle data transformations before loading it into the database.
- The task provided a basic understanding of ETL processes in Python and how to interact with SQLite databases programmatically.

#### **4. Writing and Running Basic Unit Tests Using PyTest**
- We installed and set up the PyTest framework for testing Python functions.
- We wrote basic unit tests for a sample function to verify that it behaved as expected (e.g., adding two numbers correctly).
- Running the tests ensured the correctness of the function and helped us understand how to use PyTest for automated testing.

#### **5. Microsoft Azure Setup**
- I created a Microsoft Azure account and connected it to your GitHub account for easier integration with projects.
- I also received $100 worth of free credits from Microsoft Azure, which will be helpful for deploying and testing applications on the cloud platform.
- This step is crucial for taking your projects to the next level by utilizing cloud resources for scalability and flexibility.

### **Key Learning and Accomplishments Today:**
- **Data Processing with Python**: We learned to work with CSV and JSON data formats and automate processing tasks.
- **Building a REST API**: We gained hands-on experience with Flask to create an API, a critical skill for backend development.
- **ETL Pipeline Creation**: We implemented an ETL pipeline, gaining valuable knowledge of data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Testing with PyTest**: We established unit tests for verifying the functionality of Python code, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Microsoft Azure Setup**: We set up an Azure environment linked to GitHub, and you received free credits, which will support future cloud-based deployments.
