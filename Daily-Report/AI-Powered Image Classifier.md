## Steps

1. **Project Setup:**
    
    - Initialized a Python virtual environment.
    - Installed necessary dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, etc.).
2. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    
    - Gathered a dataset of images for classification.
    - Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
3. **Model Selection:**
    
    - Selected a pretrained model (e.g., MobileNet).
    - Loaded the model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Training and Fine-Tuning:**
    
    - Configured the model for transfer learning.
    - Fine-tuned the model on the specific dataset.
5. **Testing and Validation:**
    
    - Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
    - Adjusted hyperparameters to optimize results.
6. **Deployment:**
    
    - Packaged the model for local testing.
    - Explored options for deployment (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, or cloud services).

## Issues Faced

1. **Large Repository Size:**
    
    - Encountered issues with Git due to large files in the repository.
    - Used `git filter-repo` to remove unnecessary large files from history.
2. **Dependency Conflicts:**
    
    - Resolved version mismatches for TensorFlow and other libraries.
3. **Training Errors:**
    
    - Handled errors related to input shape mismatches.
    - Addressed out-of-memory errors by reducing batch size and optimizing image preprocessing.
4. **Model Fine-Tuning Challenges:**
    
    - Experimented with learning rates and optimizer configurations to stabilize training.
5. **Remote Repository Issues:**
    
    - Fixed errors like "src refspec main does not match any" by ensuring the correct branch and remote setup.
6. **Debugging Large Files:**
    
    - Identified and removed large files using `git verify-pack` and `git filter-repo` command
