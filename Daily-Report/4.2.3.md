### **Deploying the Model in a Docker Container**

Deploying the model in a Docker container is a crucial part of deploying machine learning models in production environments. Docker allows you to create a portable environment that ensures consistency across different systems. The process involved several steps, and along the way, we faced a few challenges.

Let’s break down how we **deployed the model in a Docker container** and the challenges we encountered.

### **Step 1: Create a Python Script for the Flask App (API)**

The first step was to create a simple **Flask web server** that would serve the trained model. Flask is a lightweight framework in Python, making it ideal for serving machine learning models via a simple REST API.

1. **Install Flask**: We installed Flask in the project:
    
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```
    
2. **Create a `app.py` file**: This file contains the logic to handle incoming requests, load the trained model, and return predictions.
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Load the saved model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
    
    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        img = request.files['file']
        img = image.load_img(img, target_size=(28, 28), color_mode='grayscale')
        img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
        img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
    
        prediction = model.predict(img_array)
        predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
        return jsonify({"prediction": int(predicted_class)})
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    
    - In this script, we use Flask to create an endpoint `/predict`, which accepts image files via POST requests.
    - The model is loaded with `model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')` and used to make predictions.
    - The image is processed and resized to match the input shape expected by the model.
    
    **Challenges We Faced**:
    
    - **File Handling in Flask**: We needed to correctly handle the incoming image files, including loading and preprocessing them to match the model's input. At first, we had some issues where the image data wasn’t being properly converted into the correct format for the model. After debugging, we ensured the image was loaded and resized appropriately.
        
    - **Model Loading**: The model loading process (`model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')`) required the model to be saved earlier in `.h5` format. If the model was not saved correctly or if there was a mismatch in TensorFlow versions, it would throw errors when loading. We had to ensure the saved model was compatible with the Flask app.

### **Step 2: Create a Dockerfile**

A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image for our Flask app.

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**: We created a Dockerfile that would define the environment for running the Flask app inside the container.
    
    Here's the Dockerfile:
    
    ```dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.9-slim
    
    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app
    
    # Install any needed dependencies
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    
    # Expose port 5000 for the Flask app
    EXPOSE 5000
    
    # Define environment variable for Flask app
    ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
    
    # Run the app when the container launches
    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    ```
    
    - The Dockerfile uses the **`python:3.9-slim`** image, a lightweight image that is well-suited for Python applications.
    - We set the working directory to `/app`, copied our files into the container, and installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    - The Dockerfile then exposes port `5000` for the Flask application and specifies that Flask should be run on `0.0.0.0` to listen on all network interfaces, making the app accessible outside the container.
2. **Create a `requirements.txt`**: This file lists all the dependencies required for the Flask app to run inside the Docker container.
    
    Here's the `requirements.txt`:
    
    ```txt
    tensorflow==2.10.0
    flask==2.2.0
    numpy==1.23.1
    pillow==9.1.0
    ```
    
    - We included the versions of **TensorFlow** and **Flask** that we were using, along with the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pillow`).
    
    **Challenges We Faced**:
    
    - **Compatibility Issues with TensorFlow Version**: When we were setting up the container, we faced issues with the **TensorFlow version** compatibility. We initially tried using a version that was incompatible with the Flask app. This led to errors when trying to run the app inside the container. After some trial and error, we ensured that we were using the correct version of TensorFlow that matched our environment.
        
    - **Dependency Installation**: The `requirements.txt` installation sometimes had issues with certain versions of the libraries, especially if we had mismatched versions or if some required libraries were missing. This resulted in build errors, which we solved by ensuring all dependencies were correct and compatible.

### **Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container**

Once the **Flask app** and **Dockerfile** were set up, the next step was to **build the Docker image** and **run the container**.

1. **Build the Docker image**: We built the Docker image using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    docker build -t mnist-flask-app .
    ```
    
    - This command builds the image based on the current directory (which includes the Dockerfile and other necessary files). The image was tagged as `mnist-flask-app`.
2. **Run the Docker container**: After building the image, we ran the container:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 mnist-flask-app
    ```
    
    - This command runs the container and maps port `5000` inside the container to port `5000` on the host, which is the port our Flask app listens on.

---

### **Step 4: Testing the API**

Once the Docker container was running, we tested the `/predict` endpoint by sending a **POST request** with an image to see if the model was predicting correctly.

We used tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test the API. The request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@test_image.png" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

- This sends an image file (`test_image.png`) to the Flask app's `/predict` endpoint, and the app responds with the predicted class.

---

### **Challenges We Faced During Deployment**

1. **Model Loading Issues in Docker**: Initially, we had issues loading the model in the Docker container due to version mismatches or missing dependencies. We had to make sure the model was correctly saved and compatible with the version of TensorFlow installed inside the Docker container.
    
2. **TensorFlow Version Compatibility**: We encountered version mismatches between the version of TensorFlow used to train the model and the one available in the Docker container. This issue was resolved by ensuring that we used the same version of TensorFlow in both the development environment and the Docker container.
    
3. **Flask Configuration**: The Flask app needed some adjustments to handle file uploads correctly and preprocess images before feeding them into the model. This took some time to debug, especially when handling different image formats.
    
4. **Docker Networking**: We also had to ensure that the Flask app was accessible from outside the Docker container. Setting the Flask app to run on `0.0.0.0` (as specified in the Dockerfile) was essential to make it reachable from the host machine.

### **Conclusion**

In the end, we successfully deployed the MNIST model using **Flask** in a **Docker container**. We were able to:

- Create a REST API that served the model.
- Package the app and dependencies into a Docker image.
- Run the app in a container and make predictions via an HTTP API.

This process involved solving issues related to TensorFlow version compatibility, Flask configuration, and handling image preprocessing. Once these challenges were resolved, we had a fully functional deployment system.

This deployment workflow is a common and useful approach for serving machine learning models in production, and it showed us how Docker can provide a portable, consistent environment for machine learning applications.
