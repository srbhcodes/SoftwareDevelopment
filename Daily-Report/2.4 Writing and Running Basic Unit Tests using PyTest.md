### **Report: Writing and Running Basic Unit Tests using PyTest**

---

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this task was to write unit tests for a Python script and use the **PyTest** framework to run the tests. This ensures that the functions in the Python script are behaving as expected and helps us verify the correctness of the code.

---

### **Steps Taken:**

---

#### **Step 1: Install PyTest**

**What we did:**
- We installed `pytest` to enable us to write and run unit tests.

**Why we did it:**
- `pytest` is a widely used testing framework that allows us to automate the process of running tests and checking the correctness of the code.
- Installing it ensures we have all the necessary tools to perform testing.

**Command:**
```bash
pip install pytest
```

---

#### **Step 2: Create a Folder for Tests (Optional)**

**What we did:**
- We created a separate folder called `tests/` to store our test files.

**Why we did it:**
- Keeping tests separate from the main application code helps to organize the project. This separation makes it easier to maintain and understand the codebase.
- It also ensures that test code does not interfere with the application code.

**Command:**
```bash
mkdir tests
```

---

#### **Step 3: Write Unit Tests for the Script**

**What we did:**
- We assumed the Python script (`etl_pipeline.py`) contains a function (`add_numbers`) that we want to test.
- We wrote a test for the function `add_numbers` to check if it correctly adds two numbers together.

**Why we did it:**
- Writing unit tests for the functions allows us to validate that the functions behave as expected.
- Unit tests ensure that each small piece of functionality works correctly, helping us catch bugs early.

**Test File (`tests/test_etl_pipeline.py`):**
```python
import pytest
from etl_pipeline import add_numbers

def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(2, 3) == 5  # Test adding positive numbers
    assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0  # Test adding negative and positive numbers
    assert add_numbers(-2, -3) == -5  # Test adding negative numbers
    assert add_numbers(0, 0) == 0  # Test adding zeros
```

---

#### **Step 4: Run the Tests Using PyTest**

**What we did:**
- We ran `pytest` in the terminal to execute the tests and check if our `add_numbers` function behaves as expected.

**Why we did it:**
- Running the tests is the next step after writing them. This ensures that all tests are executed and we get feedback on whether the code is working correctly.
- `pytest` automatically finds the test files and test functions and runs them.

**Command:**
```bash
pytest
```

When the tests pass, `pytest` will display something like:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 4 items

tests/test_etl_pipeline.py ....                                              [100%]

============================== 4 passed in 0.03 seconds ================================
```

This output indicates that all tests were successful.

### **Conclusion**

1. **Installing PyTest**: We installed `pytest` to enable writing and running tests.
2. **Creating a Test Folder**: We created a `tests/` folder to store test files, ensuring better organization.
3. **Writing Unit Tests**: We wrote unit tests for the function `add_numbers()` to check for correctness.
4. **Running Tests**: We ran the tests using `pytest` to verify that the code behaves as expected.
5. **Verifying Test Results**: If any tests fail, we can easily fix the issues in the code and re-run the tests.

This concludes the steps we took to write and run basic unit tests using PyTest.
