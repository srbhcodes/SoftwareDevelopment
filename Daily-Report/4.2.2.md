### **Objective:**

We wanted to save the trained **TensorFlow model** using **Pickle**, a Python library that serializes objects into a byte stream and deserializes them back into Python objects.

Normally, **TensorFlow models** are saved using `model.save()` (in `.h5` or TensorFlow's format). However, in this task, we wanted to explore saving the model with **Pickle** to understand how it works and how it can be used in scenarios where more control over serialization is required.

### **Step 1: Save the Model Using Pickle**

1. **Pickling the Model:** The first challenge here was understanding how to serialize the entire TensorFlow model object using Pickle. TensorFlow models are complex objects, so we needed to be cautious about whether Pickle would handle them properly. Unlike simpler Python objects, saving models directly can result in some issues if the underlying architecture or weights aren't correctly serialized.
    
    The general approach to using **Pickle** is as follows:
    
    ```python
    import pickle
    
    # Save the model using Pickle
    with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(model, f)
    ```
    
    This code opens a file called `model.pkl` in write-binary mode (`'wb'`) and then uses `pickle.dump()` to serialize the model object and save it to the file.
    
    **Challenges**: The primary challenge here was whether the **TensorFlow model object** would be properly pickled. TensorFlow models contain many internal objects and custom layers, which might not always be compatible with Pickle's serialization methods.
    
    When we first attempted it, the model was not being saved as expected. This happened because:
    
    - **TensorFlow's internal components** (such as layers and optimizers) are not always compatible with the basic Pickle serialization.
    - Pickling the entire model object might lead to issues when TensorFlow tries to restore the model from the Pickle file.

### **Step 2: Load the Model Using Pickle**

2. **Loading the Model Using Pickle:** After saving the model using Pickle, we needed to load it back into memory to evaluate it on the test set.
    
    The process to load the model using Pickle was as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Load the model using Pickle
    with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        loaded_model = pickle.load(f)
    ```
    
    After loading the model, we could use it for predictions or evaluation:
    
    ```python
    test_loss, test_acc = loaded_model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
    print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
    ```
    
    **Challenges**: When we tried to load the model, we faced the following issues:
    
    - **Attribute Errors**: TensorFlow objects might not have been restored completely, resulting in `AttributeError` when trying to call methods like `evaluate()` or `predict()`.
    - **Model Weights**: If Pickle didn’t properly store the weights, the model would fail to provide meaningful results after loading. This could happen if the saved model didn’t correctly store the model’s weights, optimizer state, and layer configurations.
    
    **Fixing the Problem**: After encountering the errors, we realized that Pickle might not be the best way to handle TensorFlow models, as the internal complexities of TensorFlow (especially for things like custom layers, optimizers, etc.) are not easily serialized by Pickle. The optimal solution would have been to use `model.save()` to store the model as a `.h5` file, which is the standard way TensorFlow saves and loads models.

### **Step 3: Comparing with Standard TensorFlow Saving**

3. **Standard TensorFlow Model Saving:** While we were focused on using Pickle, we also revisited the standard **TensorFlow model saving** approach, which is done using:
    
    ```python
    model.save("model.h5")
    ```
    
    This approach is designed for TensorFlow models, and it saves everything needed (architecture, weights, optimizer state) in a format that is optimized for restoring the model later.
    
    **Benefits**:
    
    - **Compatibility**: This method is fully supported by TensorFlow and works out-of-the-box with `tf.keras.models.load_model()`.
    - **Stability**: It ensures the model, its weights, and training state are fully restored without issues.
    - **Widely Adopted**: Most machine learning workflows and deployment pipelines use this method.
    
    At this point, we understood that **Pickle was not the right tool for saving TensorFlow models** due to the complexities involved with TensorFlow's internal structures.

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

After trying to use **Pickle** and encountering issues, we concluded the following:

- **Pickle**: While it's a general-purpose Python library for object serialization, **Pickle is not recommended for saving complex objects like TensorFlow models**, which have custom internal layers, weights, and other dependencies. We faced several errors during the saving and loading process, such as attribute errors and improper deserialization of the model's architecture and weights.
- **TensorFlow’s model.save()**: This is the standard and preferred method for saving and loading models in TensorFlow. It’s specifically designed to handle complex models and provides the necessary functionality to save not only the model architecture but also its weights, optimizer, and training state.

### **Summary of Challenges We Faced with Pickle**:

1. **Pickle Compatibility**: The main issue was that **Pickle** could not properly serialize TensorFlow model objects, especially when the models contained layers, optimizers, and custom components. This led to errors when loading the model back into memory.
    
2. **Internal Components of TensorFlow Models**: TensorFlow models have many internal components, like custom layers, which **Pickle** cannot handle well by default. This resulted in deserialization issues.
    
3. **Performance and Stability**: Even when Pickle seemed to work, it could not guarantee that the model would function correctly after being loaded (i.e., incorrect weights or corrupted model state).
    
4. **Finding a Solution**: We realized that using TensorFlow's built-in `model.save()` function was much more reliable and was the proper approach for saving and loading models.
    

### **Key Takeaway**: While Pickle is great for serializing simpler Python objects, it is not well-suited for serializing complex objects like TensorFlow models. For TensorFlow models, the recommended approach is to use `model.save()` and `tf.keras.models.load_model()`.
