### Best Practices for Git Commits

- **Keep Commits Atomic**
    - **What does "atomic" mean?**
        - An atomic commit focuses on one specific change or task. It should contain a minimal set of related changes that achieve a single purpose or fix.
        - Example: If you're adding a new feature and fixing a bug, create separate commits for each task.
    - **Why is it important?**
        - Improves readability of the commit history.
        - Makes it easier to roll back or cherry-pick specific changes if needed.
        - Simplifies code reviews by keeping changes scoped and relevant.

### Handling Commit Messages

- **Exiting Vim Editor**
    
    - Sometimes, Git opens the **Vim editor** when you forget to provide a commit message using `-m`. You should know how to exit it:
        - Press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and hit Enter to save and exit.
        - To exit without saving, type `:q!` and hit Enter.
    - Alternatively, set up a different default editor (covered below).
- **When Your Commit Message is Long**
    
    - If your commit message contains multiple points, it's better to format it properly:
        - Use the **first line** for a concise summary (50 characters or fewer).
        - Leave a blank line and then provide a detailed explanation.
        - Example:
            
            ```
            Fix user authentication bug
            
            - Corrected the hashing algorithm for storing passwords.
            - Updated the login API to include proper error handling.
            - Added unit tests for edge cases.
            ```
            
- **Setting Up a Default Editor**
    
    - By default, Git uses Vim for editing commit messages or performing operations like `git commit --amend`.
    - You can configure a different editor for convenience:
        - **Command**: `git config --global core.editor "<editor_command>"`
        - Examples:
            - Use VS Code: `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
            - Use Nano: `git config --global core.editor "nano"`

### Viewing Commit History

- **`git log` Options**
    - **`git log`**: Displays detailed commit history with commit hashes, authors, and timestamps.
    - **`git log --oneline`**: Provides a compact, single-line summary of each commit, showing:
        - Shortened commit hash.
        - First line of the commit message.
        - Example:
            
            ```
            a1b2c3d Fix user authentication bug
            d4e5f6g Add new feature: User profiles
            ```

### Using Git GUI Tools

- **GitKraken**
    - **What is GitKraken?**
        - GitKraken is a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git that simplifies Git workflows through visual tools.
        - It provides features like:
            - Branch visualization.
            - Commit history browsing.
            - Drag-and-drop merging.
            - Easy conflict resolution.
        - It is especially helpful for beginners or visual learners.
    - **How to Use It:**
        - Download and install GitKraken from its official website.
        - Connect your local repositories or clone remote repositories into the GUI.
        - Perform Git operations (e.g., commits, merges, pushes) through the interface.

### Amending Commits

- **Why Amend a Commit?**
    
    - If you made a mistake in your last commit (e.g., forgot to include a file or want to change the message), you can **amend** it instead of creating a new commit.
    - Note: Amending rewrites the commit history, so avoid it if the commit has already been pushed to a remote repository.
- **How to Amend a Commit**
    
    - Steps:
        
        1. Make the necessary changes to your files.
        2. Stage the changes using `git add <filename>`.
        3. Run `git commit --amend`:
            - This opens the default editor, allowing you to edit the commit message or confirm the existing one.
        
        - Example:
            
            ```bash
            git add file.txt
            git commit --amend
            ```
            
    - After amending, the commit hash changes because itâ€™s treated as a new commit.

### Ignoring Files in Git

- **Why Use `.gitignore`?**
    
    - Some files should not be tracked by Git for security, efficiency, or convenience. Examples include:
        - **Secrets and credentials**: API keys, database credentials.
        - **Generated files**: OS-specific files, temporary files, and build artifacts.
        - **Dependencies**: Node modules (`node_modules`) or package directories.
        - **Logs and caches**: Files like `*.log` or `.cache`.
- **Creating a `.gitignore` File**
    
    - A `.gitignore` file specifies patterns for files and directories that Git should ignore.
    - Place the `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository.
    - Common examples:
        
        ```
        # Ignore node modules
        node_modules/
        
        # Ignore log files
        *.log
        
        # Ignore environment files
        .env
        
        # Ignore OS-specific files
        .DS_Store (macOS)
        Thumbs.db (Windows)
        ```
        
- **Patterns and Notations**
    
    - **Wildcard (`*`)**: Matches any number of characters.
        - Example: `*.log` ignores all `.log` files.
    - **Double Asterisk (`**`)**: Matches files in all subdirectories.
        - Example: `logs/**` ignores all files in the `logs` folder and its subfolders.
    - **Negation (`!`)**: Tracks a file or directory even if it matches an ignore pattern.
        - Example:
            
            ```
            *.log
            !important.log
            ```
            
            This ignores all `.log` files except `important.log`.
- **Testing `.gitignore`**
    
    - Use `git status` to confirm that ignored files are not being tracked.
- **Regular Expressions**
    
    - `.gitignore` supports patterns similar to regular expressions.
    - If you're familiar with regex, creating complex ignore rules becomes easier.
