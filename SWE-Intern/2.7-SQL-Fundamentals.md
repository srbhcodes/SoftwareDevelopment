Overview: Introduce SQL fundamentals for querying and managing relational databases, relevant to projects involving database interaction.

Module 8: SQL Fundamentals for C++ Developers

Module 8 focuses on equipping you with the foundational knowledge of SQL (Structured Query Language) for interacting with relational databases in C++ projects. This is essential because many C++ applications rely on databases to store and manage data.

Here's a breakdown of the key topics you might encounter:

1. SQL Syntax:

You'll learn the basic structure and syntax of SQL statements used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. This includes understanding keywords, clauses, and operators used to construct effective SQL queries.

2. Data Manipulation (DML):

This section will cover the core SQL statements used to manage data within tables:

SELECT: This statement retrieves data from a table based on specific criteria.

INSERT: This statement adds new rows of data to a table.

UPDATE: This statement modifies existing data within a table.

DELETE: This statement removes rows of data from a table.

3. Data Definition (DDL):

You'll learn how to define the structure of your database using DDL statements:

CREATE: This statement creates new tables within the database, specifying the columns (data fields) and their data types (e.g., text, numbers, dates).

ALTER: This statement allows you to modify the structure of existing tables (e.g., adding new columns, changing data types).

DROP: This statement removes tables from the database.

4. Data Control (DCL):

This section covers statements for controlling access to database objects:

GRANT: This statement assigns specific permissions (e.g., read, write) on tables or views to users.

REVOKE: This statement takes away previously granted permissions from users.

5. Basic Database Design Principles:

You'll be introduced to fundamental concepts for designing efficient and well-organized databases:

Normalization: This involves structuring your tables to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Relationships: Understanding how tables can be linked using foreign keys to establish relationships between data.

By understanding these SQL fundamentals, you'll be able to effectively interact with databases from your C++ applications. This allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently, making your applications more robust and functional.
