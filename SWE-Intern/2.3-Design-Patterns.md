Module 3.

Overview: Introduce common design patterns used in software development to solve recurring design problems.

Here's a deeper dive into each design pattern you might encounter in Module 3:

1. Singleton Pattern:

Problem: You need to ensure only one instance of a class exists throughout your application.

Solution: The Singleton pattern defines a class that controls the creation of its own instance and provides a global access point to it. There's a single, static method to get the instance, and the constructor is private to prevent direct object creation.

Benefits:

Ensures only one instance exists (e.g., a logging class that writes to a single log file).

Provides a global point of access.

Drawbacks:

Can make testing trickier (as the instance is global).

Overuse can lead to tight coupling between classes.

2. Factory Pattern:

Problem: You want to create objects without specifying the exact class type at compile time.

Solution: The Factory pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which specific class to instantiate. This allows for flexibility in choosing the type of object to create at runtime. There can be variations like Simple Factory (creates a single type) and Abstract Factory (creates families of related objects).

Benefits:

Promotes loose coupling (code doesn't depend on specific concrete classes).

Allows for centralized control over object creation.

Drawbacks:

Can introduce an extra layer of complexity.

May require creating multiple factory classes for different object types.

3. Observer Pattern:

Problem: You need a way for objects to be notified about changes in another object (often called the subject).

Solution: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the subject's state changes, it notifies all its registered observers (often through an "update" method). This allows for loosely coupled communication between objects.

Benefits:

Enables flexible communication between objects.

Decouples subjects from observers (changes in one don't directly affect the other's implementation).

Drawbacks:

Can introduce complexity with many observers.

Debugging event flow can be challenging.

4. Strategy Pattern:

Problem: You need to change an object's behavior at runtime without modifying its structure.

Solution: The Strategy pattern defines an interface for interchangeable algorithms. Different concrete classes implement the interface with specific algorithms. The object can then hold a reference to a strategy object and delegate the behavior to it.

Benefits:

Allows for dynamic switching of algorithms.

Promotes loose coupling (code doesn't depend on specific algorithms).

Drawbacks:

Can introduce overhead with extra object creation for strategies.

May require additional code to manage and switch between strategies.

5. Decorator Pattern:

Problem: You want to add new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure (avoiding subclassing).

Solution: The Decorator pattern allows attaching additional responsibilities to an object dynamically using a "decorator" class. The decorator wraps the original object and provides an extended interface.

Benefits:

Adds functionality without modifying existing class structure.

Promotes loose coupling and easier to extend functionality.

Drawbacks:

Can create a complex hierarchy of decorator classes.

Debugging can be challenging due to layered behavior.

6. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern:

Problem: You need to separate application logic (data), presentation (user interface), and user interaction (handling user input) for better maintainability and scalability.

Solution: The MVC pattern divides an application into three parts:

Model: Represents the application data and business logic.

View: Responsible for displaying the data to the user.

Controller: Handles user interaction (e.g., button clicks), updates the model, and instructs the view to update itself.

Benefits:

Promotes separation of concerns (easier to maintain and modify each part).

Improves code reusability (views can be reused with different models and controllers).

Drawbacks:

Can introduce additional complexity for smaller applications.

Requires a clear understanding of the pattern for effective implementation.
