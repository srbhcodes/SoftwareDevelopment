Overview: Establish coding standards and best practices to maintain code quality and consistency across the team.

Topics Covered:

Naming Conventions:

Companies will likely have a preferred style for naming variables, functions, classes etc. This could be camelCase, snake_case, or PascalCase. (There are pros and cons to each approach but consistency is key).

They'll explain the reasoning behind the chosen conventions (e.g., readability, clarity).

Code Formatting:

This will cover things like indentation (how much to space code in), spacing around operators, and line breaks.

Consistent formatting makes code easier to read and understand for everyone on the team.

Commenting:

You'll learn how to write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of different code sections.

Good comments are essential for understanding complex code and for future maintenance.

Error Handling:

This will cover how to identify, handle, and report errors gracefully within your code.

This ensures the program doesn't crash and provides informative messages for debugging.

Code Reuse (DRY principle):

You'll be introduced to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, which encourages writing reusable code blocks to avoid redundancy.

This improves code maintainability and reduces errors.

Code Documentation:

This might cover different ways to document code, like writing comments directly in the code or using separate documentation tools.

Good documentation helps others understand the code's functionality and purpose
