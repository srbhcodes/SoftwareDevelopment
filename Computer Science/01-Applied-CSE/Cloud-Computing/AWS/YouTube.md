## **1. Frontend Layer**

### **Technology Stack:**

- **React.js or Angular:** For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **AWS CloudFront:** A Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve the frontend application to users worldwide with low latency.
- **Amazon S3:** To host static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images for the frontend.

---

## **2. Backend Layer**

### **Technology Stack:**

- **Node.js/Express.js or Python Flask/Django:** For building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic.
- **AWS API Gateway:** To expose backend APIs securely and manage endpoints.
- **AWS Lambda:** To handle serverless compute for certain functions, such as processing video metadata.

---

## **3. Database Layer**

### **Databases:**

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Store structured data like user profiles, video metadata, likes, comments, and subscription information.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** For unstructured data or highly scalable features like storing video analytics (e.g., watch time or engagement metrics).
- **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached):** To cache frequently accessed data like trending videos or user session information for faster retrieval.

---

## **4. File Storage**

### **Video Storage:**

- **Amazon S3:**
    - Store raw uploaded videos.
    - Store processed videos in different resolutions (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p) for adaptive streaming.
    - Store thumbnails and other media assets.
- **AWS Glacier:** Archive old, rarely accessed videos to reduce storage costs.

---

## **5. Video Processing**

### **Components:**

- **AWS Elastic Transcoder:** Convert uploaded videos into various formats and resolutions for adaptive streaming.
- **AWS MediaConvert:** An alternative to Elastic Transcoder for enhanced video processing.
- **AWS Lambda:** Triggered upon video upload to initiate the transcoding process.

---

## **6. Content Delivery**

### **Streaming:**

- **AWS CloudFront:** Distribute video content globally with caching to reduce latency.
- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming):** For adaptive bitrate streaming based on user bandwidth.

---

## **7. Authentication and Authorization**

### **Security:**

- **AWS Cognito:** Manage user sign-up, sign-in, and authentication using email, social login (e.g., Google, Facebook), or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **OAuth 2.0:** For secure API access.

---

## **8. Monitoring and Logging**

### **Tools:**

- **AWS CloudWatch:** Monitor application performance, API usage, and set alarms for critical issues.
- **AWS X-Ray:** Trace user requests and debug backend services.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Track API calls and user activities for security audits.

---

## **9. Scalability and Availability**

### **High Availability:**

- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers or services.
- **AWS Auto Scaling:** Automatically scale the backend and other compute resources based on demand.

### **Fault Tolerance:**

- Deploy backend services in multiple AWS regions or Availability Zones (AZs).

---

## **10. Analytics**

### **Tools:**

- **AWS QuickSight:** Visualize user engagement, video trends, and content performance.
- **Amazon Kinesis:** Real-time analytics for events like video views, comments, or user actions.
- **Amazon Redshift:** Store and analyze large datasets for deeper insights.

---

## **11. DevOps and Deployment**

### **Tools:**

- **AWS CodePipeline:** Automate CI/CD pipelines for deploying new code to the application.
- **AWS CodeBuild:** Build and test the application.
- **AWS CodeDeploy:** Deploy updates to EC2 instances or Lambda functions.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Automate infrastructure provisioning using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

---

## **12. Security**

### **Measures:**

- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protect against DDoS attacks and SQL injection.
- **AWS Shield:** Additional protection against DDoS attacks.
- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Secure access to AWS services and resources.

---

### **Workflow Summary:**

1. **Frontend**: A user accesses the application through a browser or mobile app served by AWS CloudFront.
2. **Upload**: The user uploads a video, which is stored temporarily in S3.
3. **Processing**: The video triggers an AWS Lambda function that initiates transcoding via AWS Elastic Transcoder or MediaConvert.
4. **Storage**: Processed videos are stored in S3, ready for streaming via CloudFront.
5. **Streaming**: The user streams video through CloudFront using adaptive bitrate streaming.
6. **Engagement**: User actions (e.g., likes, comments, watch history) are stored in RDS/DynamoDB.
7. **Analytics**: User activity data is analyzed using Kinesis and visualized with QuickSight.
