Hereâ€™s a **simplified list of DBMS topics** that covers the **fundamentals** and **scalable web applications** concepts. This will help you focus on the essential areas without going into deep theoretical concepts.

---

### **1. Introduction to DBMS**

- **What is a DBMS?**: Purpose and benefits of a Database Management System.
- **Types of DBMS**: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-oriented, and NoSQL.
- **DBMS Architecture**: Three-level architecture (Internal, Conceptual, External).
- **Data Models**: Overview of relational, hierarchical, and network models.

### **2. Relational Databases and SQL**

- **Relational Model**: Tables, rows, and columns (Entities and Attributes).
- **SQL Basics**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Concepts of keys for data integrity and relationships between tables.
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN.
- **Group By, Having, and Aggregates**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex data retrieval.

### **3. Database Design and Normalization**

- **Entity-Relationship Model (ER Diagram)**: Designing databases using entities and relationships.
- **Normalization**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
- **Denormalization**: When to use it for performance improvement.
- **Schema Design**: Mapping ER diagrams to relational schemas.

### **4. Advanced SQL and Query Optimization**

- **Indexes**: Purpose of indexes (Primary, Unique, Composite, and Full-Text indexes).
- **Query Optimization**: Techniques to improve query performance (EXPLAIN command, indexing strategies).
- **Transactions**: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- **Isolation Levels**: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable.

### **5. Database Transactions and Concurrency Control**

- **Transaction Management**: What constitutes a transaction and how it's handled.
- **Concurrency Control**: Techniques like locking (pessimistic and optimistic), two-phase locking.
- **Deadlock**: How to detect and prevent deadlocks in databases.

### **6. Database Security**

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Granting and revoking permissions, user roles.
- **Encryption**: Data encryption techniques (both in transit and at rest).
- **Auditing**: Keeping track of database activities for security.

### **7. NoSQL Databases**

- **Types of NoSQL Databases**:
    - **Document Stores**: MongoDB, CouchDB.
    - **Key-Value Stores**: Redis, DynamoDB.
    - **Columnar Stores**: Cassandra, HBase.
    - **Graph Databases**: Neo4j.
- **When to Use NoSQL**: Advantages of NoSQL for unstructured or large-scale data.
- **Basic NoSQL Operations**: CRUD operations in NoSQL databases.

### **8. Data Replication and Sharding**

- **Replication**: Master-slave and peer-to-peer replication for high availability.
- **Sharding**: Distributing data across multiple machines to scale horizontally.
- **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

### **9. Database Backup and Recovery**

- **Backup Types**: Full, Incremental, and Differential backups.
- **Recovery Models**: Restoring databases from backups in case of failure.

### **10. Database Performance Tuning**

- **Indexing for Performance**: How indexes help improve retrieval times.
- **Query Caching**: How caching can speed up database queries.
- **Database Profiling**: Using tools to identify and optimize slow queries.

### **11. Distributed Databases**

- **What is a Distributed Database?**: How data is spread across multiple systems.
- **Data Distribution**: Horizontal partitioning (sharding) and vertical partitioning.
- **Distributed Transactions**: Ensuring consistency across distributed systems (e.g., using 2PC or 3PC).

### **12. Cloud Databases**

- **Cloud Databases Overview**: Databases as a service (DBaaS) in the cloud (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL).
- **Scaling in the Cloud**: How cloud databases scale (auto-scaling, replication, distributed architecture).

### **13. Data Warehousing and ETL**

- **Data Warehousing Basics**: Concepts of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) vs. OLTP (Online Transaction Processing).
- **ETL Process**: Extract, Transform, Load for data integration.

### **14. Real-World Applications and Use Cases**

- **Web Application Databases**: How databases are used in web apps for storing user data, session management, etc.
- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Database design and performance optimization in CMS like WordPress, Drupal.
- **E-commerce Databases**: Handling product catalogs, user orders, and transactions in e-commerce apps.
