- **Subnetting**: How to divide an IP network into smaller subnets.
- **Private vs. Public IPs**: Understanding private address ranges and NAT (Network Address Translation).

### **4. Routing and Switching**

- **Routers vs. Switches**: Differences between routers (Layer 3 devices) and switches (Layer 2 devices).
- **Routing Basics**: How data packets find their way across networks using routing algorithms (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- **Switching Basics**: How switches forward frames within local networks.

### **5. TCP/IP Communication and Connection Establishment**

- **TCP Three-Way Handshake**: How a reliable connection is established (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- **Flow Control and Congestion Control**: How TCP handles data transmission efficiently.
- **Connectionless Protocol (UDP)**: Uses of UDP in real-time applications (e.g., VoIP, video streaming).

### **6. Wireless Networking**

- **Wi-Fi Basics**: How wireless networks work, Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11).
- **Wi-Fi Security**: Basic encryption methods (WPA, WPA2) for secure wireless networks.
- **Bluetooth and IoT**: Basics of Bluetooth for short-range communication and its use in IoT devices.

### **7. Network Security**

- **Firewalls**: What firewalls do to protect networks.
- **VPNs**: Basics of Virtual Private Networks and their use in secure communication.
- **Encryption**: How data is encrypted over the network (SSL/TLS for HTTPS, VPN encryption).
- **DDoS Attacks**: Overview of Distributed Denial of Service attacks and how to mitigate them.

### **8. DNS and HTTP/HTTPS**

- **DNS Basics**: How domain names are translated to IP addresses (A records, CNAME).
- **HTTP vs. HTTPS**: Differences between secure and non-secure protocols.
- **DNS Caching**: How DNS resolution is cached to speed up web browsing.

### **9. Network Address Translation (NAT)**

- **What is NAT?**: How NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address.
- **Port Forwarding**: How specific services on a device are made accessible via NAT.

### **10. Network Layers in Practice**

- **Application Layer**: How high-level protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc., function.
- **Transport Layer**: How protocols like TCP and UDP enable end-to-end communication.
- **Network Layer**: IP addresses and routing mechanisms.
- **Data Link Layer**: How frames are created and sent over physical links (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- **Physical Layer**: Transmission of raw bits over physical media (cables, wireless signals).

### **11. Network Performance**

- **Bandwidth and Latency**: Differences between bandwidth (data rate) and latency (delay).
- **Throughput**: How network capacity is measured and improved.
- **Packet Loss**: Causes of packet loss and its effects on communication.

### **12. Common Networking Tools and Concepts**
